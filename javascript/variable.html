<!-- Declaration of a variable in JS.var is old one,let and const used for modern
JS. var is function scoped,let and const are block scoped.Variables declared
with var can be re-declared and updated. Let and const can be updated but not
re-declared. Variables declared with const must be initialized at the time of
declaration. they can be redeclared if one is block and another is global. -->
